# Notes

- Setup `phpMyAdmin` with `UniserverZ` and download Wordpress from the site and add to `www` folder under the C drive.
- The links don't work. Use links without the extensions at the end. E.g. replace `wp-admin.php` with `wp-admin`.
- Yes, everything got added to the gitignore except for plugins and themes. Most importantly `wp-config.php` contains sensitive information and should NEVER be added to repo.

## Theme

Blossom-recipe -> Delicious Recipes

## Plugins

Update when needed.
